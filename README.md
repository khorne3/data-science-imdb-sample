# IMDB Movie Ratings

A sample data science project in Jupyter notebook form using IMDB movie data.
The notebook does some data cleansing to refine the dataset (e.g., removing
commas from number fields), creates training and test datasets, and performs
both linear regression and random forest models with supervised learning.
